Nudity, or nakedness, is the state of wearing no clothing.[1] The deliberate and conscious wearing of clothing is a behavioural adaptation, which among all known extant and extinct animals is a uniquely human characteristic arising from functional needs such as protection from the elements. Protection from the elements includes the sun (for depigmented human populations) and cold temperatures after the loss of body hair and the migration of humans to colder regions[2] (around 100,000 years ago) in which they had not evolved and thus lacked the necessary physical adaptations.
