"Guantanamera" (Spanish: "from Guant¨¢namo, feminine" indicating a woman from Guant¨¢namo[1]) is perhaps the best known Cuban song and that country's most noted patriotic song, especially when using a poem by the Cuban poet Jos¨¦ Mart¨ª for the lyrics. In 1966, a version by American vocal group The Sandpipers, based on an arrangement by The Weavers from their May 1963 Carnegie Hall Reunion concert, became an international hit. It has been recorded by many other solo artists, notably by Julio Iglesias, Joan Baez, Jimmy Buffett, Celia Cruz, Bobby Darin, Joe Dassin, Muslim Magomayev, Jos¨¦ Feliciano, Biser Kirov, Wyclef Jean, Puerto Plata, Trini Lopez, La Lupe, Nana Mouskouri, Tito Puente, Andy Russell, Gloria Estefan and Pete Seeger, and by such groups as Buena Vista Social Club, Los Lobos, and the Gipsy Kings.
