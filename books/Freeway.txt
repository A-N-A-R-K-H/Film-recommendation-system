A controlled-access highway is a type of highway which has been designed for high-speed vehicular traffic, with all traffic flow and ingress/egress regulated. Common English terms are freeway (in Australia, South Africa and parts of the United States and Canada), motorway (in the United Kingdom, Pakistan, Ireland, New Zealand and parts of Australia), expressway (in some parts of Canada, parts of the United States, and many Asian countries), and autoroute (in Qu¨¦bec, Canada). Other similar terms include Interstate and parkway. Some of these may be limited-access highways, although this term can also refer to a class of highway with somewhat less isolation from other traffic.
