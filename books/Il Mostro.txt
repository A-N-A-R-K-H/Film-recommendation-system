The Monster of Florence (Italian: Il Mostro di Firenze) is the name commonly used by the media in Italy for a series of eight double murder cases that took place between 1968 and 1985[1] in the province of Florence. Law enforcement conducted several investigations into the cases over the course of several years. The courts reached the conclusion that the murders were not committed by a single person but by a group of at least four perpetrators who were convicted and later became known as the "Picknick Comarades". The victims were young couples parked or camped in the vicinity of Florence in dark areas during new moons. The murderers used multiple weapons, including a .22 caliber gun and knife, and excised sex organs from the bodies of the female victims, which appeared to be the motive of the crimes.
