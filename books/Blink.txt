Blinking is a bodily function; it is a semi-autonomic rapid closing of the eyelid.[1] A single blink is determined by the forceful closing of the eyelid or inactivation of the levator palpebrae superioris and the activation of the palpebral portion of the orbicularis oculi, not the full open and close.[citation needed] It is an essential function of the eye that helps spread tears across and remove irritants from the surface of the cornea and conjunctiva.
