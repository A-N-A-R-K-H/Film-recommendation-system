He Walked by Night is a 1948 police procedural film noir, directed by Alfred L. Werker and an uncredited Anthony Mann.[1] The film, shot in semidocumentary tone, was loosely based on newspaper accounts of the real-life actions of Erwin "Machine-Gun" Walker, a former Glendale, California police department employee and World War II veteran who unleashed a crime spree of burglaries, robberies, and shootouts in the Los Angeles area during 1945 and 1946.[2][3]
