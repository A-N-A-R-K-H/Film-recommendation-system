The Jerky Boys is an American comedy act from Queens, New York, whose routine consists of prank telephone calls and other related skits. Formed in 1989, the Jerky Boys were made up of childhood friends Johnny Brennan and Kamal Ahmed.[1] After Kamal left the act in 2000, the Jerky Boys continued on as a solo act featuring only Brennan, before going on hiatus after the 2001 release of their final album, The Jerky Tapes.
