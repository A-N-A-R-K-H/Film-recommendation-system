Dial M for Murder is an American crime mystery film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, starring Ray Milland, Grace Kelly, Robert Cummings and John Williams. Both the screenplay and the successful stage play on which it was based were written by English playwright Frederick Knott. The play premiered in 1952 on BBC Television,[3] before being performed on stage in the same year in London's West End in June, and then New York's Broadway in October. It was filmed in 3-D with the technology that was available at the time. Warner Bros. released Hitchcock's film in 1954, but because the popularity of 3D films was waning,[citation needed] and because Warner Bros. had just initiated a simultaneous 3D/2D release policy, there are no known play-dates in 3D for that time.[dubious ¨C discuss] It is considered by aficionados of 3D to be one of the best examples of the process.
