The Coneheads was a recurring sketch on Saturday Night Live (SNL) about a family of aliens with bald conical heads. It originated in the 1977 premiere on January 15th (episode 35: season 2 episode 11) and starred Dan Aykroyd as father Beldar, Jane Curtin as mother Prymaat, and Laraine Newman as daughter Connie. It was later made into the movie.
