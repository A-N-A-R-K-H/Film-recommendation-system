In justice and law, house arrest (also called home confinement, home detention, or, in modern times, electronic monitoring) is a measure by which a person is confined by the authorities to a residence. Travel is usually restricted, if allowed at all. House arrest is an alternative to prison time or juvenile-detention time.
