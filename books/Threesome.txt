In human sexuality, a threesome is sexual activity that involves three people at the same time.[1][2] Threesome can also refer to a love triangle, a three-way romantic relationship. Though threesome is most commonly applied to a casual sexual activity involving sexual activity among three participants, a threesome may also be found in a long-term domestic relationship, such as polyamory or a m¨¦nage ¨¤ trois.[1]
