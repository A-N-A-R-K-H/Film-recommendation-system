In thermodynamics, heat is a type of energy transfer in which energy flows from a warmer substance or object to a colder one. It can be defined as the total amount of transferred energy excluding any macroscopic work that was done and any transfer of part of the object itself.[1][2][3][4][5][6] Transfer of energy as heat can occur through direct contact, through a barrier that is impermeable to matter (as in conduction), by radiation between separated bodies, by way of an intermediate fluid (as in convective circulation), or by a combination of these.[7][8][9] By contrast to work, heat involves the stochastic (random) motion of particles (such as atoms or molecules) that is equally distributed among all degrees of freedom, while work is confined to one or more specific degrees of freedom such as those of the center of mass.
