Purple Noon (Original: Plein soleil) (Italian: Delitto in pieno sole) (a.k.a. Full Sun, Blazing Sun, Lust for Evil, and Talented Mr. Ripley)[2] is a 1960 French-Italian film directed by Ren¨¦ Cl¨¦ment, loosely based on the 1955 novel The Talented Mr. Ripley by Patricia Highsmith. The film stars Alain Delon in his first major film, along with Maurice Ronet (as Philippe Greenleaf) and Marie Lafor¨ºt (as Marge); Romy Schneider appears briefly in an uncredited role as Freddie Miles' companion, and Billy Kearns (an expatriate American actor well liked in France) plays Greenleaf's friend Freddy Miles.[3] The film, principally in French, contains brief sequences in Italian.
