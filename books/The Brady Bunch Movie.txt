The Brady Bunch Movie is a 1995 American comedy film based on the 1969¨C1974 television series The Brady Bunch. The film was directed by Betty Thomas, with a screenplay by Laurice Elehwany, Rick Copp, Bonnie and Terry Turner, and stars Shelley Long, Gary Cole and Michael McKean, featuring Davy Jones, Micky Dolenz, Peter Tork and RuPaul, and cameo appearances of the original cast from The Brady Bunch (except Eve Plumb and Robert Reed [the latter who died in 1992]) playing different characters.
