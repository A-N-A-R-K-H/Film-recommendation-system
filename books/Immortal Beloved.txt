The Immortal Beloved (German "Unsterbliche Geliebte") is the mysterious addressee[1] of a love letter which composer Ludwig van Beethoven wrote on 6¨C7 July 1812 in Teplitz. The entire letter is written on 10 small pages, in Beethoven's rather inconsistent handwriting.[2][3] The apparently unsent letter was found in the composer's estate after his death, after which it remained in the hands of Anton Schindler until his death, was subsequently willed to his sister, and was sold by her in 1880 to the Berlin State Library, where it remains today.[4] The letter is written in pencil and consists of three parts.
