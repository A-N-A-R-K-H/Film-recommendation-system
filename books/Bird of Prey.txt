A bird of prey, predatory bird, or raptor is any of several species of bird that hunts and feeds on rodents and other animals. The term raptor is derived from the Latin word rapere, meaning to seize or take by force.[1] Birds of prey have keen vision that allows them to detect their prey during flight, as well as powerful talons and beaks.
