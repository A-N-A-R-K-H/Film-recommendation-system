Friday is the day of the week between Thursday and Saturday. In countries adopting the "Monday-first" convention as recommended by the international standard ISO 8601, it is the fifth day of the week. In countries that adopt the "Sunday-first" convention, it is the sixth day of the week. In some other countries, for example Saudi Arabia and the Maldives, Friday is the first day of the weekend, with Saturday the second. In Afghanistan Friday is the last day of the weekend, with Saturday as the first day of the working week. Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Kuwait also followed this convention until they changed to a Friday¨CSaturday weekend: on 1 September 2006 in Bahrain and the UAE,[1] and a year later in Kuwait.[2] In Iran, Friday is the only weekend day.
