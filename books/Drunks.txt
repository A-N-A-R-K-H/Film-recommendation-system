Alcohol intoxication, also known as drunkenness or alcohol poisoning, is negative behavior and physical effects due to the recent drinking of ethanol (alcohol).[4][7] Symptoms at lower doses may include mild sedation and poor coordination.[1] At higher doses, there may be slurred speech, trouble walking, and vomiting.[1] Extreme doses may result in a decreased effort to breath (respiratory depression), coma, or death.[1] Complications may include seizures, aspiration pneumonia, injuries including suicide, and low blood sugar.[1][2]
