For Ever Mozart is a 1996 feature film directed, written and edited by Jean-Luc Godard. The film's title is a bilingual pun intentionally meant to sound like "Faut r¨ºver Mozart" ("Dream Mozart, dream" in French).[1] The film was selected as the Swiss entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 70th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.[2][3]
