Vertigo is a symptom where a person feels as if they or the objects around them are moving when they are not.[1] Often it feels like a spinning or swaying movement.[1][2] This may be associated with nausea, vomiting, sweating, or difficulties walking.[2] It is typically worse when the head is moved.[2] Vertigo is the most common type of dizziness.[2]
