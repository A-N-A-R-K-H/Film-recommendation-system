His Girl Friday is a 1940 American screwball comedy film filmed in B&W directed by Howard Hawks, from an adaptation by Charles Lederer, Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur of the play The Front Page by Hecht and MacArthur. This was the second time the play had been adapted for the screen, the first occasion being the 1931 film also called The Front Page.[1] The major change in this version, introduced by Hawks, is that the role of Hildy Johnson is a woman.
