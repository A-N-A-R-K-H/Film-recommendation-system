An eraser, (also called a rubber outside America,[1] from the material first used) is an article of stationery that is used for removing writing from paper or skin. Erasers have a rubbery consistency and come in a variety of shapes, sizes and colours. Some pencils have an eraser on one end. Less expensive erasers are made from synthetic rubber and synthetic soy-based gum, but more expensive or specialized erasers are vinyl, plastic, or gum-like materials.
