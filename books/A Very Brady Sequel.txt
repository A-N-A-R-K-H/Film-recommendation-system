A Very Brady Sequel is a 1996 American comedy film and sequel to The Brady Bunch Movie (1995). The film was directed by Arlene Sanford (in her feature film directorial debut), with a screenplay by Harry Elfont, Deborah Kaplan, James Berg and Stan Zimmerman, and stars Shelley Long, Gary Cole and Tim Matheson; with cameo appearances by RuPaul (reprising his role from the first film), Zsa Zsa Gabor (in her last screen role), Rosie O' Donnell, Barbara Eden (reprising her role from I Dream of Jeannie), David Spade, and Richard Belzer. Following its predecessor, the film places the 1970s Brady Bunch family in a contemporary 1990s setting, where much of the humor is derived from the resulting culture clash and the utter lack of awareness they show toward their relatively unusual lifestyle.
